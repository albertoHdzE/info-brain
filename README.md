# How mind code, saves and retrieve information. A computational approach
## Explanation [here](https://sites.google.com/view/complexai/how-mind-saves-and-recovered-information)

In the [chapter 10](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p547--introduction/) of his book A new Kind of science (2012), Stephen Wolfram gives an idea, based in his principle of [computational equivalence](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrincipleofComputationalEquivalence.html), how he thinks that the perception, storage and recovering of information in mind can be explained computationally.
In this project I found a way to implemented these ideas in order to develop an algorithm to filter (code/abstraction), save (in efficient manner where similar information remains together) and recover information (by similarity).
When a search of information take place, then, In the same spirit of the Wolfram`s idea, from relevant aspects it is capable to construct the whole original information.
